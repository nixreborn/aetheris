## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Stamina-Based Combat
- All actions consume stamina (10-50 per action)
- Natural stamina regeneration (10 per round)
- Risk/reward tradeoff for aggressive vs defensive play

### 2. Combat Mechanics
- **Attack Types**:
  - Light Attack: Fast, low cost, reliable
  - Heavy Attack: Slow, high cost, high damage, can cause bleed
  - Dodge: Evasion-based defense
  - Block: Damage reduction (60%)
  - Parry: Counter-attack on success

- **Combat Resolution**:
  - Accuracy vs Evasion checks
  - Critical hit system (5-50% chance based on stats)
  - Defense mitigation (reduces damage based on armor)
  - Status effect application and processing

### 3. Status Effects
All status effects with duration tracking:
- **DoT Effects**: Bleed, Poison, Burn (3-5 damage per round)
- **Debuffs**: Weakness (-25% attack), Frost (slow), Stun
- **Buffs**: Strength (+25% attack), Defense (+25% defense), Regeneration

### 4. Enemy System

#### Enemy Tiers
- **Basic** (Lv 1-3): 50-70 HP, 10-30 souls
- **Elite** (Lv 5-6): 100-150 HP, 50-150 souls, special abilities
- **Mini-Boss** (Lv 8): 300 HP, 150-350 souls, enrage mechanic
- **Boss** (Lv 10-12): 500-600 HP, 500-1500 souls, multi-phase
- **World Boss** (Lv 20): 2000 HP, 2000-6000 souls, raid mechanics

#### AI Behaviors
- **Aggressive**: 60% heavy attacks
- **Defensive**: 50% block/parry
- **Balanced**: Mix of all actions
- **Tactical**: Adapts to player health
- **Berserker**: 80% heavy attacks when enraged
- **Coward**: Defensive when below 50% HP

#### Resistance System
7 damage types with multipliers:
- Physical, Fire, Frost, Lightning, Poison, Dark, Holy
- 0.0 = Immune, 1.0 = Normal, 2.0 = Weak

### 5. Class Abilities

#### Resource Types
- Stamina (Warrior, Rogue, Ranger)
- Mana (Sorcerer, Paladin, Necromancer)
- Health (Necromancer's Dark Ritual)

#### Targeting Types
- Self-buffs
- Single enemy
- All enemies (AOE)
- Area effects

#### Scaling System
Abilities scale with character stats:
- Physical abilities: STR, DEX
- Magic abilities: INT, WIS
- Holy abilities: CHR, WIS
- Scaling factor: 0.1x per stat modifier point

### 6. Database Integration

Combat events logged:
- Victory/defeat records (CharacterMemory)
- Souls earned
- Experience gained
- Health/stamina changes
- Combat round details

### 7. LLM Integration

Dynamic combat descriptions:
