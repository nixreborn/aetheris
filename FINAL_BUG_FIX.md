# Final Bug Fix Summary

## Bug #7: Duplicate Widget IDs (FINAL FIX)

### Problem
Even after attempting to remove children, Textual was still creating duplicate widget IDs when refreshing character creation steps.

### Root Cause
Button widgets with IDs (race-human, class-warrior, etc.) weren't being properly removed before new ones were mounted, causing DuplicateIds errors.

### Solution
Removed IDs from race/class/faction buttons entirely and used custom attributes instead:
- Buttons no longer have IDs
- Custom attributes store the selection (btn.race_name, btn.class_name, btn.faction_name)
- Event handlers check for these attributes using hasattr()

### Changes Made
1. step_2_race(): Removed id='race-{race}', added btn.race_name attribute
2. step_3_class(): Removed id='class-{class}', added btn.class_name attribute
3. step_4_faction(): Removed id='faction-{faction}', added btn.faction_name attribute
4. on_button_pressed(): Changed from checking event.button.id to hasattr(event.button, 'race_name')

### Result
No more duplicate IDs! Buttons can be safely remounted without conflicts.

## All Bugs Fixed: 7 Total

1. Cryptography import
2. Unicode encoding
3. Import name mismatch
4. Missing logs directory
5. Textual widget mount error
6. Duplicate IDs (first attempt)
7. Duplicate IDs (final fix - no IDs on selection buttons)

Game is now fully functional!
