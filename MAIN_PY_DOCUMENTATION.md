# Characters
from characters.character import CharacterCreator, CharacterManager

# World
from world.shards import ShardManager

# Combat
from combat.system import CombatSystem

# LLM
from llm.generator import get_llm_generator

# Network
from network.master_server import MasterServer

# TUI Screens
from tui.main_screen import MainGameScreen
from tui.character_screen import CharacterCreationScreen, CharacterSheetScreen
from tui.world_screen import WorldMapScreen
from tui.combat_screen import CombatScreen

# Config
from config.settings import get_settings
```

### 9. Error Handling & Logging

Comprehensive logging:

```python
# Log to file and console
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('logs/shards.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
    ]
)

# Usage throughout:
logger.info("Game started")
logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
logger.warning("Database reset!")
```

Features:
- All major actions logged
- Error tracking
- Debug information
- Timestamp tracking
- Both file and console output

## Usage Examples

### Basic Offline Game

```bash
# First run - initializes everything
python main.py

# Creates:
# - Database (shards_of_eternity.db)
# - 12 Crystal Shards
# - 12+ Locations
# - World state
# - 4 Sample NPCs

# Then opens character selection screen
```

### Character Creation Flow

```python
# 1. User clicks "New Character"
# 2. CharacterCreationScreen opens with wizard
# 3. User completes 6 steps:
#    - Name
#    - Race (affects stats)
#    - Class (determines abilities)
#    - Faction (shapes story)
#    - Stats (60 points to allocate)
#    - Confirmation
# 4. Character saved to database
# 5. Returns to character selection
# 6. User selects character
# 7. MainGameScreen opens with character data
```

### Server Setup

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
python main.py --server

# Output:
# Starting master server on localhost:8888
# Master server running on http://localhost:8888

# Terminal 2: Connect as client
python main.py --client

# Client connects to server
# Multiplayer features enabled
```

### Database Reset

```bash
python main.py --reset-db

# Prompts: "This will DELETE ALL DATA. Are you sure? (yes/no): "
# Type: yes

# Result:
# - Drops all tables
# - Recreates schema
# - Seeds 12 shards
# - Seeds locations
# - Seeds world state
# - Seeds NPCs
# - Fresh start!
```

## Integration Points

### With Character System
```python

character = creator.create_character(
    session=session,
    name=name,
    race=race,
    character_class=char_class,
    faction=faction,
    base_stats=stats
)

# Character management
manager = CharacterManager()
manager.save_character(character)
```

### With Combat System
```python
# Combat initialization (ready for integration)
combat = CombatSystem()
combat.start_encounter(player, enemy)
```

### With LLM System
```python
# LLM generation (ready for integration)
llm = get_llm_generator()
description = llm.generate_location_description(location)
```

### With Network System
```python
# Server mode
server = MasterServer()
await server.start()

# Client mode
# Connects to server automatically
# Uses REST API and WebSocket
```

## Configuration

All configurable via `config/settings.py` or `.env`:

```python
# Database
DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
DATABASE_PATH=./shards_of_eternity.db

# Game
AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL=300  # 5 minutes
DEBUG_MODE=false

# Network
MASTER_SERVER_HOST=localhost
MASTER_SERVER_PORT=8888

# LLM
LLM_ENABLED=true
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
```

## File Structure Created

```
shards_of_eternity/
├── main.py                    # This file
├── shards_of_eternity.db      # Created on first run

└── [all other modules...]
```

## Testing

Run structure validation:

```bash
python test_main_structure.py

# Tests:
# ✓ Imports
# ✓ Database initialization
# ✓ Seeding functions
# ✓ Character creation
# ✓ Shard system
```

## Dependencies Required

From `requirements.txt`:
- textual (TUI framework)
- sqlalchemy (ORM)
- pydantic (Settings)
- aiohttp (Async networking)
- python-dotenv (Environment variables)

## Known Limitations

1. **Textual dependency**: Must be installed to run
2. **Database migrations**: Not yet implemented (use --reset-db)
3. **Multiplayer**: Client mode needs active server
4. **LLM**: Optional, requires API key
5. **Platform**: Windows paths may need adjustment on Unix

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Database migrations with Alembic
- [ ] More sophisticated autosave (delta tracking)
- [ ] Save slots (multiple saves per character)
- [ ] Cloud save support
- [ ] Import/export characters
- [ ] Mod support
- [ ] Custom shard creation
- [ ] Server browser for multiplayer

## Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'textual'"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Database locked" error
```bash
# Close all instances of the game
# Or use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
```

### Autosave not working
```python
# Check settings
settings = get_settings()
print(settings.autosave_interval)  # Should be > 0
```

### Character creation fails
```python
# Check logs
tail -f logs/shards.log

# Common issues:
# - Duplicate name
# - Invalid stat allocation
# - Database connection
```

## Code Quality

The main.py file:
- ✓ Comprehensive docstrings
- ✓ Type hints where applicable
- ✓ Error handling throughout
- ✓ Logging for debugging
- ✓ Clean separation of concerns
- ✓ Follows Python best practices
- ✓ Configurable and extensible
- ✓ Well-commented

## Summary

3. ✅ Character selection and creation
4. ✅ Multiple game modes (server/client/offline)
5. ✅ Autosave system
6. ✅ Graceful shutdown with save
7. ✅ Full system integration
