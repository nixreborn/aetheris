  - 6 primary attributes
  - Resources (health, stamina, mana)
  - Progression (level, XP, souls)
  - Location tracking
  - Timestamps

### Game Balance

#### Stat Rolling Balance

- **4d6 drop lowest**: Average 12.2 per stat, heroic characters
- **Heroic**: Average 13.3 per stat, epic campaigns
- **Point-buy**: Total 60 points, balanced builds

#### Class Balance
- Warriors: High HP/stamina, low mana
- Sorcerers: High mana, low HP
- Rogues: High stamina, balanced resources
- Paladins: Balanced across all resources
- Necromancers: High mana, low HP
- Rangers: Balanced, slightly favoring stamina

#### Level Scaling
- Exponential XP curve (prevents power leveling)
- Linear resource growth (predictable scaling)
- Class-specific stat growth (maintains class identity)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Character Creation
```python
from database import init_database
from database.models import RaceType, ClassType, FactionType
from characters import CharacterCreator

init_database()
creator = CharacterCreator()

character = creator.create_character(
    name="Thorgrim Ironheart",
    race=RaceType.DWARF,
    character_class=ClassType.WARRIOR,
    faction=FactionType.IRON_BROTHERHOOD
)
```

### Complete Character Management
```python
from characters import CharacterManager

manager = CharacterManager()

# Combat
manager.update_health(char_id, -30)  # Take damage
manager.update_stamina(char_id, -20)  # Use ability

# Progression
exp, leveled, level = manager.add_experience(char_id, 150)

# Inventory
item = manager.add_item_to_inventory(
    char_id, "Magic Sword", "weapon",
    attack_bonus=15, value=200
)
manager.equip_item(char_id, item.id)

# Get full state
summary = manager.get_character_summary(char_id)
```

## Testing

A complete example script is provided:
```bash
python examples/character_example.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Database initialization
- Character creation (both methods)
- Resource management
- Inventory operations
- Experience and leveling
- Memory system
- Currency management
- Character summaries

## Integration Points

The character system integrates with:
- **Database layer** - SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Config system** - Uses settings for database connection
- **Logging system** - Comprehensive event logging
- **World system** - Location tracking and travel

Ready for integration with:
- Combat system (health/stamina/mana updates)
- Quest system (memory logging, rewards)
- World system (location management)
- LLM system (character context for dynamic content)
- TUI system (character display and management)

## Performance Considerations

- ✅ Database sessions use context managers (auto-cleanup)
- ✅ Efficient queries with indexes
- ✅ Item stacking reduces database rows
- ✅ Single-query character summaries
- ✅ Memory limits prevent unbounded growth
- ✅ Lazy loading for relationships

## Future Enhancement Ideas

The system is designed to be extensible:
- Skills and abilities system
- Quest tracking integration
- Faction reputation tracking
- Character relationships
- Achievement system
- Appearance customization
- Background stories
- Party system
- PvP tracking
- Leaderboards
- Character templates

## Code Quality

- ✅ Type hints throughout
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Logging at appropriate levels
- ✅ Constants for magic numbers
- ✅ Separation of concerns
- ✅ DRY principle followed
- ✅ Clear naming conventions

## Documentation
